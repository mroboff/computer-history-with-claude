The directory where your VMs are stored. Each VM lives in its own subdirectory \
containing a launch.sh script and disk images. You can use ~ for your home directory."""

[default_memory]
title = "Default Memory"
description = """
RAM to allocate for new VMs (in MB). 2048-4096 MB works for most OSes. \
Windows 10+ and modern Linux benefit from 4096+."""

[default_cpu_cores]
title = "Default CPU Cores"
description = """
CPU cores for new VMs. 2-4 is usually sufficient. Don't exceed your physical \
core count minus 1-2 for host stability."""

[default_disk_size]
title = "Default Disk Size"
description = """
Virtual disk size (in GB). Disks use qcow2 format and grow as needed, \
so larger sizes don't immediately use space."""

[default_display]
title = "Default Display"
description = """
How VM windows are displayed. GTK: native look. SDL: lightweight. \
Spice: best for remote access and Looking Glass."""

[default_enable_kvm]
title = "Enable KVM"
description = """
Hardware-accelerated virtualization for near-native performance. \
Requires Intel VT-x or AMD-V CPU. Strongly recommended."""

title = "Confirm Before Launch"
description = """
Show confirmation before launching VMs. Helps prevent accidental launches \
with passthrough configurations."""

title = "GPU Passthrough"
description = """
Configure GPU passthrough for gaming VMs. Requires IOMMU support and \
proper VFIO configuration."""

[gpu_passthrough_disabled]
title = "Disabled"
description = """
Standard virtualized graphics using emulated VGA (virtio-vga, QXL). \
Good for general use, not for gaming."""

[enable_multi_gpu_passthrough]
title = "Multiple GPUs"
description = """
Pass a secondary GPU to the VM while keeping primary for host. \
Ideal for gaming VMs on multi-GPU systems."""

[multi_gpu_ivshmem_size]
title = "IVSHMEM Size"
description = """
Shared memory for Looking Glass (MB). 32MB for 1080p, 64MB for 1440p, \
128MB for 4K. Must be power of 2."""

[show_gpu_warnings]
title = "Show GPU Warnings"
description = """
Display warnings when GPU passthrough prerequisites are not met."""

title = "Auto-launch Looking Glass"
description = """
Auto-start Looking Glass client after VM boots for zero-latency GPU display."""

[enable_single_gpu_passthrough]

description = """
Temporarily unbinds your only GPU and passes it to the VM. \
Must run from TTY, stops display manager."""

[single_gpu_run_setup]
title = "Run System Setup"
description = """
One-time system configuration for single-GPU passthrough. Creates \
/etc/modules-load.d/vfio.conf and /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf, then \
regenerates initramfs. Requires root and a reboot to take effect."""

[single_gpu_auto_tty]

EXPERIMENTAL: Auto-switch TTY when starting/stopping VM. \
May not work with all setups."""
